# Inevitable probability
This repository contains the code and data used to obtain the results reported in the following paper:

Orhan AE, Ma WJ (2017) Efficient probabilistic inference in generic neural networks trained with non-probabilistic feedback. *Nature Communications*. [[arXiv:1601.03060](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03060)]

The bulk of the code is written in [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) + [Lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Each folder contains code and data pertaining to a particular model type or experiment.

The code for generating the results reported in Figure 9 (qamar2013) is written in Matlab and uses some routines from the Matlab Statistics and Optimization Toolboxes. Some of the files are written to be run on a local computer cluster. You may need to modify them according to your needs.
